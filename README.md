# Polyglot WTW (With Translation Widget) - Translation AI assistant OBS Plugin + Translation Widget support

## WHY a new fork of Polyglot called Polyglot WTW

To meet streamers' need for translation tools that work with StreamElements for widget creation, and to incorporate open source initiatives, this fork was created.
If you don't want to use StreamElements, consider switching to the basic OBS proposal, which is the best alternative.

Thanks to Royshil for creating the obs plugin and core engine

## Introduction

Polyglot translation AI plugin allows you to translate text in multiple languages in real-time and locally on your machine. ✅ No GPU required, ✅ no cloud costs, ✅ no network and ✅ no downtime! Privacy first - all data stays on your machine.

"polyglot" is derived from the Greek words: "poly-" meaning "many"and "glōtta" (or "glōssa") meaning "tongue" or "language".

It's using the excellent [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2) project from [OpenNMT](https://opennmt.net/).
